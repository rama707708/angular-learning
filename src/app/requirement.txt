Build an Angular application to manage a list of contacts. 
The app should support Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations
using a form that combines multiple input fields.

Form Inputs for Each Contact:
Full Name (Text input)
Email Address (Email input)
Phone Number (Number or Tel input)
Address (Textarea or multiline input)
Contact Type (Dropdown: Friend, Family, Work, Other)

CRUD Operations:
 Add a new contact
 View a list of all contacts
 Edit an existing contact 
 Delete a contact

Validation Rules:
Name: Required, min 3 characters
Email: Required, must be a valid email
Phone: Required, min 10 digits
Contact Type: Required

Additional points:
Store contacts in localStorage so they persist on reload
Add a search bar to filter contacts by name or type
Add pagination if contacts exceed 5+ entries
Export contact list as CSV
